# 11.1 INHERITANCE

# Inheritance allows a new class to extend an existing class.
# The new class inherits the members of the class it extends.
# Inheritance and the "Is a" relationship

# When one object is a specialized version of another obect,
# there is an "is a" relationship between them.
# Example:
# A poodle is a dog.
# A car is a vehicle.
# A flower is a plant.
# A rectangle is a shape.
# A football player is an athlete.

# When an "is a" relationship exists between objects, it means
# that the specialized object has all of the characteristics
# of the general object, plus additional characteristics
# that make it special.

# In OOP, inheritance is used to create an "is a" relationship
# among classes.
# This allows you to extend the capabilities of a class by
# creating another class that is a specialized version of it.

# Inheritance involves a superclass, and a subclass.
# The Superclass is the general class, and the Subclass
# is the specialized class.
# You can think of the Subclass as an extended version of
# the Superclass.
# The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the Superclass
# without any of them having to be reqritten.
# Furthermore, new attributes and methods may be added
# to the subclass, and that is what makes it a specialized
# version of the Superclass.

# NOTE:
# Superclasses are also called base classes, and subclasses
# are also called derived classes. Either set of terms is
# correct.
